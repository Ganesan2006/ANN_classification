# Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project demonstrates how to build a classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a structured dataset for binary or multiclass classification.

## 📌 Description

The notebook walks through the complete machine learning workflow:
- Loading and preprocessing data
- Building and compiling the ANN model
- Training the model on the dataset
- Evaluating performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (filename not specified in this README). It is assumed to be preprocessed or in a clean format suitable for direct ingestion by pandas.

## 🛠️ Technologies / Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
